It is created purely for **learning, practice, and reference**.

### 🧭 How to use this repository effectively
1. Each file is named after the **exact LeetCode problem title**.
2. Go to LeetCode and **read the problem statement carefully**.
3. Try solving the problem **on your own first**.
4. If you’re stuck, refer to the solution in this repository:
   - ❌ Do **not** copy the query directly.
