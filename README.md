## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the **LeetCode Top 50 SQL** problems, created purely for learning and practice purposes.

### How to use it effectively
1. Each file is named after the **exact LeetCode question title**.
2. Go to LeetCode and read the problem statement carefully.
3. Try to solve the problem on your own first.
4. If you’re stuck, refer to the solution in this repository.
   - Do **not** copy the query directly.
   - Focus on understanding the logic and approach.
5. After a short break, go back to LeetCode and write the solution yourself from scratch.

### Important note
This repository is intended **only for educational purposes**.  
The goal is to learn SQL patterns and problem-solving techniques, not to memorize answers.
